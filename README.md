### Humidity Fan Control
very simple Arduino sketch to control a humidity regulator for bath room and/or basement.
it reads temperature and humidity from 2 DHT sensors and controls a fan based on Dewpoint difference

in short: turns the fan on only when air is dryer outside than inside, otherwise turns it off
